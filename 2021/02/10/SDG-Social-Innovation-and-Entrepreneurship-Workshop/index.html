        <p>​    Last week, I participated in a workshop on social innovation and entrepreneurship, which is also one of the SDG. I am really interested in this topic, because that is what I want to contribute to in the future. In my previous understanding, social enterprises are groups of people who have dreams in building a better world. Anyways, this workshop did let me learnt more and deeper about social enterprises as well as entrepreneurship, so keep on read my post and find out what happened.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Enterprises"><a href="#Social-Enterprises" class="headerlink" title="Social Enterprises"></a>Social Enterprises</h3><p>​    First off, the host of this lecture made a brief but comprehensive introduction on what are social enterprises and what do they responsible for. I’ve also learnt about several social enterprises, such as People Tree and Innocent. Here is one example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People Tree is the pioneer in Fair Trade and sustainable fashion, and prides itself on continually working towards meeting Fair Trade standards throughout its supply chain and trading operations. When you shop with People Tree, you can trust that your goods were made ethically and sustainably. People Tree is a different kind of fashion business. We give customers an alternative to fast fashion. The fast fashion industry is fueled an by insatiable demand for cheap clothing and accessories. Fast fashion has a devastating impact, from sweatshops and child labor to pollution and global warming. Slow Fashion means standing up against exploitation, family separation, slum cities and pollution – all the things that make fast fashion so successful. </p>
<p>( People tree social review 2011-2012)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    The host is a member of a social enterprise, she shared the experience of entering this organization and what did she do in the past, which is really encouraging. However, though there are a large number of social enterprises in the world today, at the same time, a number of them fail to keep on running the organization. </p>
<p>​    I started to wonder why this happen. Well, by the way, undoubtedly, I am always worship for people who contribute to social enterprises no matter how they did. I found that most of them are due to <strong>lack of fund</strong>. Some social enterprises organized rechargeable activities, and they attract people by providing free activities, such as workshop. </p>
<p>​    Let’s take SRP(Social Responsible People) as an example. Actually, I’ve been participated in several activities organized by it and keep on pay attention to how it works. Well, I found that, the most activities it does is keep on making workshops. However, honestly, I think they spend a bit much time on advertising. So, in my view, it is understandable for doing advertisement, but we should not forget our purpose, and we should try our best to let those participants gain something after attending the workshop. In a word, the quality is really essential.</p>
<p>​    Above is just one of the reasons, which is lack of fund, and I attempt to learn more about why do they fail, and more precisely, what can be the source of fund.</p>
<h3 id="Entrepreneurship"><a href="#Entrepreneurship" class="headerlink" title="Entrepreneurship"></a>Entrepreneurship</h3><p>​    Then we focused more on entrepreneurship. At first, I thought that set an start up is all about how much capital you have, because this is such a crucial world controlled by money. However, after hearing different ideas and stories, it is totally not what I thought.</p>
<p>​    We did a game that each group considered as one business, and we were put in a mock situation to think that whether there is any opportunity for us to make a start up or enter the social market. Participants provided many creative and cool ideas. And I realized that <strong>entrepreneurship is about “sparks”</strong>, that is business ideas. Everyone could be entrepreneur .</p>
<p>​    So how to be a good entrepreneur? In other words, what qualities a good entrepreneur requires? Basically, you need to be optimistic, initiative, critical, organized, self-motivated and so on to face rapid changing market and situation. A young entrepreneur shared his story that he set up an media company as well as an extra-class art school since university. </p>
<p>​    One thing he mentioned really touched me. He didn’t want his art school to be a factor for art exams, but for simulating people’s interest and cultivating artistic talent. In this way, he gave up providing exam training, which is a really profitable one that even all his competitors are doing. This made me realize that in the process of starting a business,  <strong>we should not blindly forget the original purpose for profit.</strong></p>
<p>​    The first and foremost thing for we guys, people who are full-time student, to prepare for being entrepreneurs is to make ourselves have solid professional foundation.</p>
<p>​    Additionally, we also talked about several popular industry in today’s world, especially in China, such as internet celebrity economy, old-age care, we-media and so on. I gained a lot of information and new ideas, at the same time, I met many people who shared same interest with me.</p>
<h3 id="More-thoughts"><a href="#More-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="More thoughts"></a>More thoughts</h3><p>Data shows that more and more female started to be entrepreneurs , and, what is interesting is, most of the people worked in social enterprises are female. In my opinion,the first reason is the awakening of women’s self-awareness. The second reason is that due to gender differences, women are more sensitive and full of empathy, so a larger proportion of women will participate in public welfare activities. Of course, this has to do with the fact that society has developed so that women have more opportunities.</p>

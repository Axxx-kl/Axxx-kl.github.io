<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In many countries, informal employment is an important part of the economy as well as labor market, which plays an significant role in national development. Among the various types of informal economy, the street vending economy is one of the topics that we have paid close attention to recently. This is not only because it is an indispensable existence in the economy and culture of every country, but also because the influence of Covid-19 has brought about great changes in it, affecting many people and places. </p>
<p>Therefore, it is one of our most important work to study the street vending economy and analyze its development prospect.</p>
<p>This article will first give a brief overview of the impact of Covid-19 on different stakeholders of the street vending economy, mainly the mobile vendors themselves, so as to show the problems exposed in the current situation and the importance of taking measures. Based on the analysis and evaluation of the measures taken by different countries and regions in the world towards the governance of mobile street vendors, the similarities and differences between different policies and measures are summarized to show the attitudes of mainstream countries towards the street vendor economy, taking China as the main example. On the basis of the above two points, this paper puts forward several suggestions for the development of the street vendor economy in the future, especially for the management of the mobile street vendor.</p>
<h2 id="Influences-of-the-Covid-19-to-Different-Stakeholders-of-the-Street-Vending-Economy"><a href="#Influences-of-the-Covid-19-to-Different-Stakeholders-of-the-Street-Vending-Economy" class="headerlink" title="Influences of the Covid-19 to Different Stakeholders of the Street Vending Economy"></a>Influences of the Covid-19 to Different Stakeholders of the Street Vending Economy</h2><h4 id="Street-Vendors"><a href="#Street-Vendors" class="headerlink" title="Street Vendors"></a>Street Vendors</h4><p>Due to the emergence of Covid-19, many countries in the world implemented the policy of urban blockade, with China taking the lead. Urban residents were forced to isolate themselves at home and reduce the number of outings. This has had a huge impact on the real economy, while the street vending economy is one of them.</p>
<p>Under this condition, vendors were not allowed to sell their goods at all, so their source of income was cut off. Take China as an example, according to Chinese Professor Chen’s research, the mobile street vendors in China are composed of the unemployed, farmers, wage earners, workers and businessmen[1]. From this we can see that stall business is almost a majority of mobile vendors all source of income. This has had a huge impact on the lives and even survival of mobile vendors. </p>
<p>Even in areas where the city has not been locked, the lives of street vendors have been hit hard as well. This due to dramatic decreasing of consumers, cause by, for example, people are reluctant to buy goods from street stalls for fear of infection.</p>
<h4 id="Economy-and-Social"><a href="#Economy-and-Social" class="headerlink" title="Economy and Social"></a>Economy and Social</h4><p>In <strong>Women</strong> <strong>and Men</strong> <strong>in the Informal Economy, 3rd Edition</strong>: A Statistical Picture, the International Labour Organization shows that 61 per cent of the world’s workforce is engaged in the informal economy[2]. Since street vendors make up a large proportion, this is partly responsible for the increase in local unemployment. In addition, because of the lockdown, customers can not buy goods from the street vendors, and the mobile street vendors are forbidden to operate, which inevitably leads to the reduction of people’s consumption. At the same time, since street vendors may have a strong linkage with formal economy, for example, they source the goods they sell from formal enterprises, and many customers, even some of the vendors, work in formal jobs, this may have influences on the formal economy as well, such as the supply chain. Thus, the economy has also been influenced back to some extent.</p>
<p>As for the society itself, the existence of mobile vendors represents the local or urban culture to some extent, which is not conducive to the development and dissemination of regional culture under the influence of the epidemic. In some cases, such a lockdown could trigger a humanitarian crisis, with street vendors protesting against the measure. This has led to social unrest, increased conflict between street vendors and the government, and also increased people’s sense of panic about the future, which is not conducive to social harmony. In Zimbabwe, for example, local authorities in many places have acted, destroying vendors’ stalls and making mass arrests of poor workers</p>
<h2 id="Attitudes-and-Management-Measures-towards-Mobile-Vendors-During-the-Epidemic"><a href="#Attitudes-and-Management-Measures-towards-Mobile-Vendors-During-the-Epidemic" class="headerlink" title="Attitudes and Management Measures towards Mobile Vendors During the Epidemic"></a>Attitudes and Management Measures towards Mobile Vendors During the Epidemic</h2><h4 id="Early-Stages-of-the-Epidemic"><a href="#Early-Stages-of-the-Epidemic" class="headerlink" title="Early Stages of the Epidemic"></a>Early Stages of the Epidemic</h4><p>In the early stage of the epidemic, countries, led by China, strictly prohibited the operation of street vendors. Peru, for example, imposed a one-month nationwide blockade on March 16, 2020. The gradual implementation of urban blockades around the world was mainly aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19, but this greatly affected the livelihood of the street vendors, leading to a series of problems as mentioned before.</p>
<h4 id="Post-epidemic-Period"><a href="#Post-epidemic-Period" class="headerlink" title="Post-epidemic Period"></a>Post-epidemic Period</h4><p>With the spread of the epidemic gradually stabilized, some measures have been taken around the world to respond. Controversial is China’s move to liberalize street vendors, which it claims is aimed at reviving the country’s economy. </p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks at a news conference after the third session of the 13th National People’s Congress in Beijing, May 28, 2017. During the conference, he praised the policies of some cities to encourage itinerant street vendors while solving employment problems. Since then, local governments in China have encouraged the development of the street vending economy and liberalized some regulatory regimes, even though the country had previously been negative about vendors, both before the outbreak and in the early stages.</p>
<p>In addition to policy easing, China’s major enterprises have also carried out the support of the street vending economy. Alibaba, for example, offers more than 70 billion yuan in interest-free credit, supporting more than 30 million vendors.</p>
<p>Although such a move in China has boosted consumption and investment to a certain extent and helped the economic recovery, there are still several aspects to note. The first and most important thing is to strengthen the epidemic control in the areas where mobile vendors gather. Take food for example. In China, stalls selling snacks and food have a certain historical and cultural status. However, in the context of Covid-19, encouraging stalls economy means that local governments should strengthen the control of food safety, which is not only related to the prosperity of the market and the promotion of consumption, but also related to the health and life safety of the public. In response, local governments have introduced various policies to provide protection. For example, in December 2020, Shanghai issued a document on the operation and management of food vendors.</p>
<p>As we know, the epidemic has had a devastating impact on the jobs and survival of street vendors. In addition to the policy changes, NGOs around the world have also taken steps to provide support and protection to street vendors. For example, street vendor groups across the United States have created a unified demand platform. It centers on their immediate socio-economic needs and looks at a just economy that recognizes the value of street vendors and the contribution of their businesses.</p>
<h2 id="Suggestions-on-the-Management-of-Street-Vending-Economy-Under-the-Normalization-of-Epidemic-Prevention-and-Control"><a href="#Suggestions-on-the-Management-of-Street-Vending-Economy-Under-the-Normalization-of-Epidemic-Prevention-and-Control" class="headerlink" title="Suggestions on the Management of Street Vending Economy Under the Normalization of Epidemic Prevention and Control"></a>Suggestions on the Management of Street Vending Economy Under the Normalization of Epidemic Prevention and Control</h2><p>When the epidemic has been stabilized and controlled in the world, the management of the street vending economy in the future needs to be paid more attention.</p>
<p><strong>Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO)</strong>[3] claims that the impact on informal workers is not just in the short term. In essence, giving priority to supporting and satisfying the needs of the vulnerable groups and helping and supporting the street vendors are the basis and premise for further governance of the stall economy. This helps to improve the happiness of the people, especially the street vendors and the poor. It helps to weaken the conflicts and contradictions between the people and the government to a certain extent, so as to stabilize the society and the people, which is extremely important in the context of the turmoil of the epidemic. In the stable social environment, and then carry out the further management and control of the street vendor economy.</p>
<p>The topic that management street vending economy does not open from beginning to end is how to promote the formalization of street vending economy. Under the background of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control in the future, local governments could carry out specific measures to regularize the street vendors according to the political goals of different periods and the specific local conditions. At the same time, public health and safety precautions should be strengthened. In addition, local governments can work with local social or community organizations to raise public awareness. The close relationship between the government and the masses is conducive to later policy adjustment and planning</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Street vending economy is an important part of the world economy, which has indispensable significance and status for promoting economic development. Due to the impact of the epidemic, it has been impacted to a certain extent, which also makes countries in the world pay more attention to it. Today, as the epidemic gradually stabilizes, it is a very important topic for countries in the world to govern and normalize the market economy according to their own political goals</p>

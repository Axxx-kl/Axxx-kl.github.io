    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>​    Before launching the desk research on the street vending economy, I attended lectures given by Professor Huang of Sun Yat-sen University. It gave me a lot of inspiration and thought.</p>
<h1 id="Reasons"><a href="#Reasons" class="headerlink" title="Reasons"></a>Reasons</h1><p>​    First, we need to understand why we study on this topic today, which is related to the social and economic origin of the existence and development of urban street vendors.</p>
<p>The most common opinion is that most street vendors exist due to unemployment. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many developing countries, economic reforms and underdevelopment, as well as unemployment caused by the financial crisis, have been cited as the main reasons for the remarkable expansion of vendors. (Cross 1998; Mitullah 2004;<br>Lonrenço-Lindell,2004; Skinner 2008;Chaudhuri 2009 )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    However, this view and China’s actual situation is contradictory. Compared China with other developing countries, it is obvious that China has a relatively high GDP growth, and report shows that lack of needed labor happens in most places.</p>
<p><strong>So here comes the problem,  what is the socio-economic factors in the development of urban stallholders in China?</strong></p>
<p>​    According to Pro. Huang ‘s research, farmers, workers, the unemployed, business people and salaried people are five types of people make up the street vendors in China.</p>
<p>​    Here is the main reasons, according to Pro. Huang.</p>
<ol>
<li>Overly exploitative working conditions drive workers (migrant workers) into hawkers</li>
<li>Rural poverty drives farmers to the cities to work as street vendors, part-time or full-time</li>
<li>Lack of job opportunities has encouraged the unemployed to seek their last livelihood as street vendors</li>
<li>In an increasingly competitive business environment, businessmen or would-be businessmen become hawkers in order to seek transition, refuge or accumulation of capital</li>
<li>Urban poverty encourages low-income workers to work part-time as street vendors to make up for their families</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h1><p>​    From the perspective of Chinese history, in different historical stages, national or local governments would adopt different attitudes and strategies to control street vendors due to different phased political goals</p>
<p>​    There are several reasons why we should ban urban street vendors now based on China’s national condition.</p>
<pre><code>1. Hawkers clamp down on the implementation of development strategies embedded in the municipality to create a beautiful urban space and image and improve the capital attraction.
 2. Street vendors are chaotic symbols of space, which do not meet the national goal of a healthy city.
 3. There have been several clashes between street vendors and law enforcement groups in the city</code></pre>
<h1 id="Solutions"><a href="#Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Solutions"></a>Solutions</h1><p>​    As can be seen from many cases in history, banning or expelling street vendors is neither inevitable nor unchangeable. It depends on how to define and view the position and significance of street vendors in social development, and how it relates to the political and economic goals of the government.</p>
<h2 id="The-conduct-of-conducts"><a href="#The-conduct-of-conducts" class="headerlink" title="The conduct of conducts"></a>The conduct of conducts</h2><p>​    Through the establishment of “mobile street vendors guidance area”, the guidance area reflects the spatial nature of governance, which realizes the discipline and transformation of behavior by placing mobile street vendors in a specific space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Governmentality, generally referred to as the conduct of conducts, indicates generalized and diverse power-seeking practices aiming to form and guide the actions, behaviors and inner states of others or the self      (Foucault,2007; Huxley, 2008)</p>
<p>‘The deliberations, strategies, tactics and devices employed by authorities for making up and acting upon a population and its constituents to ensure good and avert ill’. (Rose, 1996: 328)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="The-internal-contradiction-between-the-rationality-and-street-vendors"><a href="#The-internal-contradiction-between-the-rationality-and-street-vendors" class="headerlink" title="The internal contradiction between the rationality and street vendors"></a>The internal contradiction between the rationality and street vendors</h3><h4 id="Fixed-location-vs-Mobility"><a href="#Fixed-location-vs-Mobility" class="headerlink" title="Fixed location vs Mobility"></a>Fixed location vs Mobility</h4><p>​    Although fixed location management rebuilds the order of public space and facilitates management, it also damages the characteristics of mobility as the nature of mobile vendors</p>
<h4 id="Rent-payment-vs-Low-cost"><a href="#Rent-payment-vs-Low-cost" class="headerlink" title="Rent payment vs Low cost"></a>Rent payment vs Low cost</h4><p>​    Low cost is the main characteristic of the mobile merchant economy, which not only makes it easy for the mobile merchant to enter, but also enables the practitioner to have a comparative competitive advantage compared with the regular business.</p>
<p>​    In terms of fairness, it is reasonable to pay rent because mobile vendors use public space resources and earn economic income from them.</p>
<p>​    However, rent collection has two negative consequences, which weaken the social justice value of the diversion area. Firstly, rent payment excludes street vendors with poor economic ability. Secondly, paying rent may would bring unsatisfied revenue to street vendors.</p>
<h4 id="Contract-constrain-vs-Flexibility"><a href="#Contract-constrain-vs-Flexibility" class="headerlink" title="Contract constrain vs Flexibility"></a>Contract constrain vs Flexibility</h4><p>​    The system of lease contract used to restrain the main body of modern market economy stifles the flexibility characteristic of mobile traders, that is, it eliminates the irregular nature of mobile traders as a kind of employment that people can choose to enter and exit at any time according to actual needs, thus affecting the attraction of the distribution area</p>
<h4 id="Product-control-vs-Autonomy"><a href="#Product-control-vs-Autonomy" class="headerlink" title="Product control  vs  Autonomy"></a>Product control  vs  Autonomy</h4><p>`Product type regulations, while conducive to avoiding competition with formal commerce and maintaining the urban landscape, impair the autonomy of vendors to choose products according to market needs.</p>
<p>The artificial regulation of product types makes it impossible for vendors to choose products according to the surrounding market needs and consumer preferences.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>There are still many problems for us to solve on the road of regulating and governing the stallholder economy.</p>
<p>My research topic would start from the view of economics, focused on the relationship between street vending economy and formal economy, and based on such basic desk research, if it is possible, I would like to conduct a social research to see the operation benefit of street vendors and its influencing factors in Nanjing, and to see how the condition of Covid-19 and changes in the regulation would affect it.</p>

          <p>When learning corporate social responsibility, I did a small research on Tencent’s CSR, and here is what I found.</p>

<h2 id="Help-deal-with-Covid-19"><a href="#Help-deal-with-Covid-19" class="headerlink" title="Help deal with Covid-19"></a>Help deal with Covid-19</h2><p>​    During the covid-19, Tencent conferences were open to users free of charge, providing telecommuting for enterprises and providing remote consultation for medical institutions.</p>
<p>​    Tencent Cloud’s SMS service, which covers more than 1,000 operators in more than 200 countries and regions around the world, can help government departments quickly pass on epidemic prevention information to the public. </p>
<p>​    Tencent also set up an online platform to provide the public for real-time data about the global Covid-19.</p>
<p>​    Tencent set up the Global War Epidemic Fund in March this year to procure and donate important medical supplies such as masks, ventilators and protective equipment to the hardest-hit areas of the new crown outbreak.</p>
<p>​    Tencent cooperated with FC Barcelona Foundation to deliver personal protective equipment to FC Barcelona. The protective materials are distributed to Catalan medical staff through the club foundation network</p>

<p>( The Barcelona Foundation received the first batch of protective clothing on April 12 )  </p>
<h2 id="Environmental-protection"><a href="#Environmental-protection" class="headerlink" title="Environmental protection"></a>Environmental protection</h2><p>​    Tencent and China Environmental Monitoring Station jointly launched the “Air Quality” query service to help the public get the most authoritative urban environmental air quality data released by the authorities in the first place. At the same time, the two sides will also carry out in-depth cooperation in the construction of environmental monitoring cloud platform, promote the construction of environmental supervision and information technology. </p>
<p><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/08/yURdW4.png" alt="yURdW4.png"></p>
<h2 id="Inheriting-traditional-Chinese-culture"><a href="#Inheriting-traditional-Chinese-culture" class="headerlink" title="Inheriting traditional Chinese culture"></a>Inheriting traditional Chinese culture</h2><p>​    Tencent has launched a number of projects to spread traditional Chinese culture in China and even around the world through digital technology. For example, since 2016, Tencent and Great Wall have formally cooperated to inherit and promote the spirit of the Great Wall from multiple levels such as charity fundraising, image incubation, and cultural education, so that the Great Wall culture will regain its charm. </p>
<p>​    Among them, the “Protect the Great Wall, Add One” public fundraising project, as of December 31, 2018, attracted nearly 400,000 people to participate in the Great Wall Protection Fundraiser, becoming the cultural heritage public welfare project with the largest number of fundraising and participation on Tencent’s public welfare platform.</p>

<p>Then I have a question:  <strong>How to understand the logic behind the behavior of China liberalized the regulation of the street vendors in the post-epidemic period?</strong></p>
<p>Under the circumstance that the epidemic has been basically under control, China gradually loosened the control of street vendors. The reasons are all centered on the theme of restoring China’s economy and making all walks of life gradually get on the right track.</p>
<p>The main reason is to boost consumption as well as investment. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to data, in the first 2 months of 2020, total retail sales of consumer goods reached 5.213 billion yuan, down 20.5 percent year on year.  (National Bureau of Statistics)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goods sold by street vendors are often cheaper than the same goods sold in stores, which greatly facilitates our consumption. At the same time, because of the epidemic, people are isolated at home, forbidden to go out. Many people very much want to go to some entertainment places to relax, and even some people will appear what we call revenge consumption behavior, so loosening the control of street vendors can stimulate the consumption of this part of the population. This is not only good for the country’s economy, but also to ease people’s tension during the epidemic, improve people’s quality of life during such period to some extent, and help maintain social stability.</p>
<p>While this could drive the operation of various industries, so as to help restore the normal operation of China’s economy and economic recovery. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first two months of 2020, the added value of industrial enterprises above designated size fell by 13.5% year-on-year, and the national service production index fell by 13.0% year-on-year. (National Bureau of Statistics)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> By encouraging street vending to promote its related industries, such as the production of certain products, transportation and other aspects.</p>
<p>This also related to employment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unemployment rate has risen in January and February, particularly in February, when it hit 6.2 percent, compared with 5.3 percent in January. (National Bureau of Statistics)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main reason for the rise in the unemployment rate in February was still the impact of the epidemic, which affected the production and business activities of enterprises and reduced the demand for employment, thus reducing the number of employed people. With a low threshold, everyone can operate the business, which can greatly increase the number of jobs, especially for the people who cannot find suitable jobs. The street vending economy can help them create profits, increase income and improve the life of the whole family. With the recovery of the production order of enterprises driven by it, the employment rate of enterprises is constantly improving.</p>
<p>In general, liberalizing the regulation of the market economy will not only help promote China’s economic recovery, but also enrich people’s lives and maintain social stability. Although there are some risks, such as food safety and epidemic prevention and control, these risks can be avoided under certain control, so that China’s various industries can get on the right track.</p>

          <p>This is the first time that I participated in a workshop on the sustainable development of the United Nations. The theme of this workshop is about gender equality, which is also one of the sustainable development goals that I personally pay more attention to.</p>
<p>I learned a lot of professional knowledge about gender equality, as well as some information and expectations of the United Nations for this sustainable goal. For example, data shows that women did most of the housework and unpaid work, and what’s interesting is that phones and internet could promote the development gender equality. However, there was big disaster in 2020, which was Covid-19. It is shocked that Covid-19 push development of gender equality back to 25 years ago, which is really unbelievable. We could see that Covid-19 had a numerous effect not only on economy and health care, but also on humanity.</p>
<p>One big part what I extremely focused on is domestic abuse, which is also a big topic under gender equality. I learnt a project that help overseas Chinese with domestic abuse. This is also the first project in China that pays attention to this aspect.<br>These overseas cases are more difficult to deal with, mainly due to the identity restrictions of these Chinese, language barriers and cultural conflicts. One case I learnt made me think about not only on gender equality, but also on human equal rights and racisms, because the Chinese women in this case was discriminated by her lawyer as well as her jury which cause her to lose the case.</p>
<p>During the discussion time, I found that most cases we talk about are about females. It seems like gender equality is only about help female get their equal rights, which to some extent, is not exactly the same. Though at the first beginning, the start of gender equality was about female indeed, but as it developing, it is more about bring both female and male to a same social stage. We do need to help those female who are in trouble, because most of them are struggling in the dis-equality, however, at the same time, we should also pay attention to male, which is important as well.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the first step we need to do is to break those stereotypes. I talked to many people in the workshop, some of them are founders of social enterprises and some of them are doing such work to promote the development of gender equality. Then I found that what they did was really encouraging, which is what I want to do in the future, and I get more and more interested in such work. I plan to join more in such activities in the future to have the chance to communicate with different people from different background, and I really want to be one of the members of them.</p>

<p>It will also boost 5g construction in China and around the world. </p>

<p>​    Due to the impact of Covid-19 this year, there are certain restrictions on the way we conduct research, so many people use desktop research methods for academic research.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-desk-research"><a href="#What-is-desk-research" class="headerlink" title="What is desk research?"></a>What is desk research?</h2><p>Desk research involves reanalysis, interpretation or review past data. The role of the researcher is always to specify how past data informs his or her current research. Compared with first-hand research, desktop research is easier, especially because researchers are less involved in the actual data collection process.</p>
<h2 id="Steps"><a href="#Steps" class="headerlink" title="Steps"></a>Steps</h2><p>​    Since this holiday I will carry out a desktop study on the street vendor economy, the following step-by-step instructions for the desk study also initially show the general steps and logic of my research, so I will also use the street vendor economy as an example to illustrate</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Present-your-research-questions"><a href="#Step-1-Present-your-research-questions" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Present your research questions"></a>Step 1 Present your research questions</h3><p>​    First, determine the general topic, and then read through the existing papers to find out whether the direction I determine can fill the gaps in the existing academic research, and on this basis, determine the specific research direction.</p>
<h3 id="Step-2-Find-secondary-data-sets"><a href="#Step-2-Find-secondary-data-sets" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Find secondary data sets"></a>Step 2 Find secondary data sets</h3><p>​    Most research begins by specifying what is known and what seems to be missing on the subject. This process involves considering the types of data previously collected for the topic. At this point, after reviewing the literature and specifying the research questions, a decision can be made rely on secondary data. You can do this if you find that past data can be fully reused in your own research. </p>
<p>​    But how can you find past data useful for your research? You can do this by looking at literature related to topics of interest to you. In this process, you will identify other researchers, organizations, institutions, or research centers that have explored your research topic.</p>
<p>​    Most importantly, be sure to get the permission of the original author before using the data.</p>
<h3 id="Step-3-Evaluate-secondary-data-sets"><a href="#Step-3-Evaluate-secondary-data-sets" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Evaluate secondary data sets"></a>Step 3 Evaluate secondary data sets</h3><p>​    Because the data we collected may have some defects, such as lack of reliability or not consistent with our research topic, we need to evaluate these collected data and data sets.</p>
<p>​    You could ask yourself several questions to conduct this process, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the purpose of original research, whether it match your chosen topic?</p>
<pre><code> 2.  Who, when, and how did the data collected, whether it is reliable?</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Step-4-Prepare-and-analyze-auxiliary-data"><a href="#Step-4-Prepare-and-analyze-auxiliary-data" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 Prepare and analyze auxiliary data"></a>Step 4 Prepare and analyze auxiliary data</h3><p> After going through all those process above, you need to start preparing and analyzing. This depends on whether the research is qualitative or quantitative. Personally, I would conduct the street vendor economy research qualitatively first, after that, I would start to collect my primary data based on the qualitative outcome, and then start the quantitative research.</p>

          <p>​    I am Alexis from NFLS. I may a little serious at first sight, but after getting to know me well, you will discover a completely different me.</p>
<p>​    Many of my classmates who worked with me on projects consistently evaluated me as a very logical and organized person, which is absolutely true. I am very proud of having the ability to arrange and plan things reasonably well. Even though you might think that it is not a big thing, many people cannot do it. I set weekly, monthly and annual goals for myself, and even set objectives for different life stages in the long term future. In order to achieve my final goal, I am used to adjusting my plan and reflecting on it frequently. Such a habit makes me feel that what I am doing every moment is meaningful. </p>
<p>​    If you don’t even know the target, what is the point of practicing bow drawing every day? I adopt the same approach to studying as well, which greatly helps my time management skills. In addition, I am accustomed to making my projects, speeches or articles look very logical and structured. </p>
<p>​    All of the above shows that I am capable of managing a team. Apart from that, what I  particularly enjoy is observing my  surroundings and analyzing people’s characteristics people. This not only enables me to develop friendly relationships with most people due to my strong people skills, but also to excel at identifying others’ talent, which is also necessary for a team manager.</p>
<p>​    However, in my opinion, there are still a lot of skills I need to improve, for example, I wish to be more creative and adept at academic analyzing. Anyway, still a long way to go.</p>

<p>​    Though my team didn’t get to the final, the three-month mock trading did taught me a lot, not only in investment but also in team collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="Investment-skills"><a href="#Investment-skills" class="headerlink" title="Investment skills"></a>Investment skills</h2><p>​    First of all, I learnt many techniques which could help analyze the stock trend, company and the whole industry, and try to apply those into the final report writing, such as, SWOT analysis, PESTLE analysis, Five Force Model and so on. Though these are simple and basic techniques, it is still a challenge for us to use them in real analysis rather than exam paper. </p>
<p>​    Apart from that,  we attempted to use mathematical methods to predict the trends. Here is one example of our work.</p>
<p>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/yZofbt"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/01/yZofbt.png" alt="yZofbt.png"></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Considering the huge difference between an industry giant and small entrepreneurial enterprise just finished Angel round, we use several mathematic skills, basically linear regression, to track the Beyond meat data back to 2010 the value of time. Then, to make the prediction actually useful, we make an a little bit more complex refixation on the parameters for giving a useful prediction. The basic principles, is based on a thought, that we have to realize, different from Beyond Meat, Meatable is a truly Biotechnology Company, that means the developing cost will be much higher, and their company growth will appear a distinct platform, It is also special that, Meatable’s products are food, they hope their products are at normal price, they will not start being cheap, but will finally become necessities in economic. We assume, Meatable will put their first product in volume production in 3 years, and then the second and followings will be much quicker, which is actually a relatively optimistic assumption. </p>
<p>So in the final prediction, we see their net profit and EBITA will not be beautiful in 5 years, because I don’t believe they will low the price successfully such soon, neither will the food crisis come so soon, yet you may tell that the EBITA margin will grow. They will have a tough financing target in three years, to have this prediction we also refer to Impossible food and Melphis Meat. We believe the mean source of funds will still comes from VC companies and personal investors, there may be other investment or even donations from government, organizations or people. </p>
<p>The funds will mostly be used on the development of products firstly, then they will cost a lot on purchasing cell reactors for volume production, they will also need money on marketing in the future, but that may be not so soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    Beyond that, we learnt to read, understand and analyze reports of different companies, such as balance sheet and cash flow statement, which needs much basic knowledge of accounting and finance.</p>
<h2 id="Team-work"><a href="#Team-work" class="headerlink" title="Team work"></a>Team work</h2><p>​    Basically, this is a team work. However, go through the three-month period, I found that we didn’t do a great job on team collaboration.</p>
<p>​    First of all, we  randomly assigned different sections to the members and then conduct separate research. This was really unreasonable. For stock research, everyone has their own different parts they interested or good at, and, the most important is, we should conduct ONE portfolio for our customer based on the case study, and this is about portfolio management. </p>
<p>​    Additionally, as the leader of the group, I didn’t make great connection with every member. It is really important for a leader to get members of the group keep close contact. How to organize a group discussion effectively is what I need to think about.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-improve"><a href="#How-to-improve" class="headerlink" title="How to improve"></a>How to improve</h2><p>​    Firstly, the learning of professional knowledge and skills is the most basic and most important. According to the two reports we have written, what is more important is the lack of professionalism and the lack of investment thinking, which is also the most important point of the organizer. The cultivation of investment thinking can not be formed in a day or two, which requires me to read a lot, absorb a lot of different information, and constantly think and reflect.</p>
<p>​    As for the management of the organization, I need to reasonably arrange tasks according to the characteristics and abilities of each person. For leaders, it is more necessary to have a general control and planning for the long-term direction of the whole team.</p>

          <p>[TOC]</p>
<p>​    </p>
<p>​    This is a general overview and my personal reflection on the final report of our team.</p>
<h2 id="Portfolio-allocation"><a href="#Portfolio-allocation" class="headerlink" title="Portfolio allocation"></a>Portfolio allocation</h2><p>​    Generally speaking, due to the impact of the epidemic on the global economy this year, we have not invested very actively in various industries. Nevertheless, our team focused on the main investment targets in technology and medicine, hoping to bring some help to the development of technology and medicine through investment in some enterprises. In addition to these two sections, we also invest in disruptive companies in other sections to help them develop, or invest in companies with better development prospects to make our entire portfolio more effective.</p>
<h2 id="Team-policy"><a href="#Team-policy" class="headerlink" title="Team policy"></a>Team policy</h2><p>​    In our team organization, each member is responsible for at least two investment sections, and conducts research, analysis and long-term investment observation on the sections that is good at and familiar with. Every week we will have regular group meetings to report and share the basic situation of the section that we are responsible for this week, and at the same time, group members could share some professional knowledge with each other. </p>
<h2 id="Investment-strategies-on-each-sector"><a href="#Investment-strategies-on-each-sector" class="headerlink" title="Investment strategies on each sector"></a>Investment strategies on each sector</h2><p>​    Next part, I will briefly show you how we did in some sectors and how we think when trading.</p>
<h3 id="Health-care"><a href="#Health-care" class="headerlink" title="Health care"></a>Health care</h3><p>​    **About Hengrui Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd **</p>
<p>​    \1. Accelerated improvement in performance on a month on month basis.</p>
<p>​    \2. Financial indicators remain stable.</p>
<p>​    \3. The R &amp; D investment continued to focus on the 4 quarters of innovative drug medical insurance negotiations.</p>
<p>​    \4. The risk of epidemic affecting sales; the risk of uncertainty in the approval of products under research; the risk of excessive impact on quantity procurement</p>
<p>​    Overall, we hold this stock with an amount of around 3000, and had a positive return form it.</p>
<h3 id="Financial-service"><a href="#Financial-service" class="headerlink" title="Financial service"></a>Financial service</h3><p>​    <strong>About Ningbo Bank</strong></p>
<p>​    The recent trend of the stock is relatively stable, with resistance at the top and support at the bottom, with obvious characteristics of shock. This kind of trend shows that the strength of both sides is equal, followed by directional choice. </p>
<p>​    In recent years, the return on net assets of the banking industry has been declining, but when we look at Ningbo bank, we will see another scene. As shown in the figure. </p>
<p>​    We can clearly see that although the ROE decreased slightly in 2019, it did not change much compared with 2015, and the trend was quite flat. What’s more, according to the annual report of Ningbo Bank in 2019, we can see that the net interest income increased by only 2.3% in 2019, among which the interest expenditure grew faster than the interest income. The proportion of net interest income in total income decreased from 65.7% to 55.8%. Net income from fees and commissions increased by 34%, and other non-interest income increased by 93%. So we concluded that it has strong profitable, and the stock is growing fast, which makes it has a good prospect. Ningbo Bank’s asset quality control has always been excellent, which makes the performance of Ningbo bank very strong during the epidemic. So we chose it! </p>
<h3 id="Consumer-durable"><a href="#Consumer-durable" class="headerlink" title="Consumer durable"></a>Consumer durable</h3><p><strong>About Midea</strong></p>
<p>​    Midea actively promotes the channel reform and strengthens the company’s retail capacity. It gradually builds a multi-brand system, and enhances the brand effect. Meanwhile, the company continues to promote the industrial Internet and digitization, comprehensively improves the overall operation efficiency, and has a promising future development. Strong business cycle superposition, industry prosperity degree upward. The reason why Midea’s third-quarter report exceeded expectations is that its business cycle has increased, which has expanded its advantage in the industry’s recovery channel. The company shows ability to resist pressure and innovate could make a good fluence in the future. The upward business cycle comes from the company’s all-round reform along the three main axes of “product leading, efficiency driven and global operation”, and the expected future business cycle will continue to rise.</p>
<p>​    In the durable goods sector, we first focus on Suning and the United States, because they are more common in our life. Based on the above analysis of Midea, we choose to buy. </p>
<h3 id="Consumer-staples"><a href="#Consumer-staples" class="headerlink" title="Consumer staples"></a>Consumer staples</h3><p>​    I am going give you a summary of investing advice from the perspective of your investors. Investing in Meatable will be high-risk, but also high reward, and you’d better look it in long-turn. So our advice is, if you are a large investment firm, or super billionaire, like Bill Gates, you have a lot of money to invest in multiple companies, do a risk diversification and make a layout on the whole industry, Meatable is definitely worthy to be considered. And we would like to offer you a relative flexible contract, you may leave just after a period, or keep wary even after the IPO, like what Bill Gates has done on Beyond Meat, selling most part of the stocks in the right time soon after the IPO, and keep small portion in as your layout. </p>
<p>​    Those four sections above are the main one we focus in this competition. Overall, we have a positive return rate after the whole trade, however, there is not much and we found some aspects that we need to improve and focus on. These reflection will be covered in my next post.</p>

<p>​    </p>
<p>​    Due to the impact of Covid-19 this year, there are certain restrictions on the way we conduct research, so many people use desktop research methods for academic research.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-desk-research"><a href="#What-is-desk-research" class="headerlink" title="What is desk research?"></a>What is desk research?</h2><p>Desk research involves reanalysis, interpretation or review past data. The role of the researcher is always to specify how past data informs his or her current research. Compared with first-hand research, desktop research is easier, especially because researchers are less involved in the actual data collection process.</p>
<h2 id="Steps"><a href="#Steps" class="headerlink" title="Steps"></a>Steps</h2><p>​    Since this holiday I will carry out a desktop study on the street vendor economy, the following step-by-step instructions for the desk study also initially show the general steps and logic of my research, so I will also use the street vendor economy as an example to illustrate</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Present-your-research-questions"><a href="#Step-1-Present-your-research-questions" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Present your research questions"></a>Step 1 Present your research questions</h3><p>​    First, determine the general topic, and then read through the existing papers to find out whether the direction I determine can fill the gaps in the existing academic research, and on this basis, determine the specific research direction.</p>
<h3 id="Step-2-Find-secondary-data-sets"><a href="#Step-2-Find-secondary-data-sets" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Find secondary data sets"></a>Step 2 Find secondary data sets</h3><p>​    Most research begins by specifying what is known and what seems to be missing on the subject. This process involves considering the types of data previously collected for the topic. At this point, after reviewing the literature and specifying the research questions, a decision can be made rely on secondary data. You can do this if you find that past data can be fully reused in your own research. </p>
<p>​    But how can you find past data useful for your research? You can do this by looking at literature related to topics of interest to you. In this process, you will identify other researchers, organizations, institutions, or research centers that have explored your research topic.</p>
<p>​    Most importantly, be sure to get the permission of the original author before using the data.</p>
<h3 id="Step-3-Evaluate-secondary-data-sets"><a href="#Step-3-Evaluate-secondary-data-sets" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Evaluate secondary data sets"></a>Step 3 Evaluate secondary data sets</h3><p>​    Because the data we collected may have some defects, such as lack of reliability or not consistent with our research topic, we need to evaluate these collected data and data sets.</p>
<p>​    You could ask yourself several questions to conduct this process, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the purpose of original research, whether it match your chosen topic?</p>
<pre><code> 2.  Who, when, and how did the data collected, whether it is reliable?</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Step-4-Prepare-and-analyze-auxiliary-data"><a href="#Step-4-Prepare-and-analyze-auxiliary-data" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 Prepare and analyze auxiliary data"></a>Step 4 Prepare and analyze auxiliary data</h3><p> After going through all those process above, you need to start preparing and analyzing. This depends on whether the research is qualitative or quantitative. Personally, I would conduct the street vendor economy research qualitatively first, after that, I would start to collect my primary data based on the qualitative outcome, and then start the quantitative research.</p>

          <p>​    I am Alexis from NFLS. I may a little serious at first sight, but after getting to know me well, you will discover a completely different me.</p>
<p>​    Many of my classmates who worked with me on projects consistently evaluated me as a very logical and organized person, which is absolutely true. I am very proud of having the ability to arrange and plan things reasonably well. Even though you might think that it is not a big thing, many people cannot do it. I set weekly, monthly and annual goals for myself, and even set objectives for different life stages in the long term future. In order to achieve my final goal, I am used to adjusting my plan and reflecting on it frequently. Such a habit makes me feel that what I am doing every moment is meaningful. </p>
<p>​    If you don’t even know the target, what is the point of practicing bow drawing every day? I adopt the same approach to studying as well, which greatly helps my time management skills. In addition, I am accustomed to making my projects, speeches or articles look very logical and structured. </p>
<p>​    All of the above shows that I am capable of managing a team. Apart from that, what I  particularly enjoy is observing my  surroundings and analyzing people’s characteristics people. This not only enables me to develop friendly relationships with most people due to my strong people skills, but also to excel at identifying others’ talent, which is also necessary for a team manager.</p>
<p>​    However, in my opinion, there are still a lot of skills I need to improve, for example, I wish to be more creative and adept at academic analyzing. Anyway, still a long way to go.</p>

<p>​    Though my team didn’t get to the final, the three-month mock trading did taught me a lot, not only in investment but also in team collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="Investment-skills"><a href="#Investment-skills" class="headerlink" title="Investment skills"></a>Investment skills</h2><p>​    First of all, I learnt many techniques which could help analyze the stock trend, company and the whole industry, and try to apply those into the final report writing, such as, SWOT analysis, PESTLE analysis, Five Force Model and so on. Though these are simple and basic techniques, it is still a challenge for us to use them in real analysis rather than exam paper. </p>
<p>​    Apart from that,  we attempted to use mathematical methods to predict the trends. Here is one example of our work.</p>
<p>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/yZofbt"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/01/yZofbt.png" alt="yZofbt.png"></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Considering the huge difference between an industry giant and small entrepreneurial enterprise just finished Angel round, we use several mathematic skills, basically linear regression, to track the Beyond meat data back to 2010 the value of time. Then, to make the prediction actually useful, we make an a little bit more complex refixation on the parameters for giving a useful prediction. The basic principles, is based on a thought, that we have to realize, different from Beyond Meat, Meatable is a truly Biotechnology Company, that means the developing cost will be much higher, and their company growth will appear a distinct platform, It is also special that, Meatable’s products are food, they hope their products are at normal price, they will not start being cheap, but will finally become necessities in economic. We assume, Meatable will put their first product in volume production in 3 years, and then the second and followings will be much quicker, which is actually a relatively optimistic assumption. </p>
<p>So in the final prediction, we see their net profit and EBITA will not be beautiful in 5 years, because I don’t believe they will low the price successfully such soon, neither will the food crisis come so soon, yet you may tell that the EBITA margin will grow. They will have a tough financing target in three years, to have this prediction we also refer to Impossible food and Melphis Meat. We believe the mean source of funds will still comes from VC companies and personal investors, there may be other investment or even donations from government, organizations or people. </p>
<p>The funds will mostly be used on the development of products firstly, then they will cost a lot on purchasing cell reactors for volume production, they will also need money on marketing in the future, but that may be not so soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    Beyond that, we learnt to read, understand and analyze reports of different companies, such as balance sheet and cash flow statement, which needs much basic knowledge of accounting and finance.</p>
<h2 id="Team-work"><a href="#Team-work" class="headerlink" title="Team work"></a>Team work</h2><p>​    Basically, this is a team work. However, go through the three-month period, I found that we didn’t do a great job on team collaboration.</p>
<p>​    First of all, we  randomly assigned different sections to the members and then conduct separate research. This was really unreasonable. For stock research, everyone has their own different parts they interested or good at, and, the most important is, we should conduct ONE portfolio for our customer based on the case study, and this is about portfolio management. </p>
<p>​    Additionally, as the leader of the group, I didn’t make great connection with every member. It is really important for a leader to get members of the group keep close contact. How to organize a group discussion effectively is what I need to think about.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-improve"><a href="#How-to-improve" class="headerlink" title="How to improve"></a>How to improve</h2><p>​    Firstly, the learning of professional knowledge and skills is the most basic and most important. According to the two reports we have written, what is more important is the lack of professionalism and the lack of investment thinking, which is also the most important point of the organizer. The cultivation of investment thinking can not be formed in a day or two, which requires me to read a lot, absorb a lot of different information, and constantly think and reflect.</p>
<p>​    As for the management of the organization, I need to reasonably arrange tasks according to the characteristics and abilities of each person. For leaders, it is more necessary to have a general control and planning for the long-term direction of the whole team.</p>

<p>​    This is a general overview and my personal reflection on the final report of our team.</p>
<h2 id="Portfolio-allocation"><a href="#Portfolio-allocation" class="headerlink" title="Portfolio allocation"></a>Portfolio allocation</h2><p>​    Generally speaking, due to the impact of the epidemic on the global economy this year, we have not invested very actively in various industries. Nevertheless, our team focused on the main investment targets in technology and medicine, hoping to bring some help to the development of technology and medicine through investment in some enterprises. In addition to these two sections, we also invest in disruptive companies in other sections to help them develop, or invest in companies with better development prospects to make our entire portfolio more effective.</p>
<h2 id="Team-policy"><a href="#Team-policy" class="headerlink" title="Team policy"></a>Team policy</h2><p>​    In our team organization, each member is responsible for at least two investment sections, and conducts research, analysis and long-term investment observation on the sections that is good at and familiar with. Every week we will have regular group meetings to report and share the basic situation of the section that we are responsible for this week, and at the same time, group members could share some professional knowledge with each other. </p>
<h2 id="Investment-strategies-on-each-sector"><a href="#Investment-strategies-on-each-sector" class="headerlink" title="Investment strategies on each sector"></a>Investment strategies on each sector</h2><p>​    Next part, I will briefly show you how we did in some sectors and how we think when trading.</p>
<h3 id="Health-care"><a href="#Health-care" class="headerlink" title="Health care"></a>Health care</h3><p>​    **About Hengrui Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd **</p>
<p>​    \1. Accelerated improvement in performance on a month on month basis.</p>
<p>​    \2. Financial indicators remain stable.</p>
<p>​    \3. The R &amp; D investment continued to focus on the 4 quarters of innovative drug medical insurance negotiations.</p>
<p>​    \4. The risk of epidemic affecting sales; the risk of uncertainty in the approval of products under research; the risk of excessive impact on quantity procurement</p>
<p>​    Overall, we hold this stock with an amount of around 3000, and had a positive return form it.</p>
<h3 id="Financial-service"><a href="#Financial-service" class="headerlink" title="Financial service"></a>Financial service</h3><p>​    <strong>About Ningbo Bank</strong></p>
<p>​    The recent trend of the stock is relatively stable, with resistance at the top and support at the bottom, with obvious characteristics of shock. This kind of trend shows that the strength of both sides is equal, followed by directional choice. </p>
<p>​    In recent years, the return on net assets of the banking industry has been declining, but when we look at Ningbo bank, we will see another scene. As shown in the figure. </p>
<p>​    We can clearly see that although the ROE decreased slightly in 2019, it did not change much compared with 2015, and the trend was quite flat. What’s more, according to the annual report of Ningbo Bank in 2019, we can see that the net interest income increased by only 2.3% in 2019, among which the interest expenditure grew faster than the interest income. The proportion of net interest income in total income decreased from 65.7% to 55.8%. Net income from fees and commissions increased by 34%, and other non-interest income increased by 93%. So we concluded that it has strong profitable, and the stock is growing fast, which makes it has a good prospect. Ningbo Bank’s asset quality control has always been excellent, which makes the performance of Ningbo bank very strong during the epidemic. So we chose it! </p>
<h3 id="Consumer-durable"><a href="#Consumer-durable" class="headerlink" title="Consumer durable"></a>Consumer durable</h3><p><strong>About Midea</strong></p>
<p>​    Midea actively promotes the channel reform and strengthens the company’s retail capacity. It gradually builds a multi-brand system, and enhances the brand effect. Meanwhile, the company continues to promote the industrial Internet and digitization, comprehensively improves the overall operation efficiency, and has a promising future development. Strong business cycle superposition, industry prosperity degree upward. The reason why Midea’s third-quarter report exceeded expectations is that its business cycle has increased, which has expanded its advantage in the industry’s recovery channel. The company shows ability to resist pressure and innovate could make a good fluence in the future. The upward business cycle comes from the company’s all-round reform along the three main axes of “product leading, efficiency driven and global operation”, and the expected future business cycle will continue to rise.</p>
<p>​    In the durable goods sector, we first focus on Suning and the United States, because they are more common in our life. Based on the above analysis of Midea, we choose to buy. </p>
<h3 id="Consumer-staples"><a href="#Consumer-staples" class="headerlink" title="Consumer staples"></a>Consumer staples</h3><p>​    I am going give you a summary of investing advice from the perspective of your investors. Investing in Meatable will be high-risk, but also high reward, and you’d better look it in long-turn. So our advice is, if you are a large investment firm, or super billionaire, like Bill Gates, you have a lot of money to invest in multiple companies, do a risk diversification and make a layout on the whole industry, Meatable is definitely worthy to be considered. And we would like to offer you a relative flexible contract, you may leave just after a period, or keep wary even after the IPO, like what Bill Gates has done on Beyond Meat, selling most part of the stocks in the right time soon after the IPO, and keep small portion in as your layout. </p>
<p>​    Those four sections above are the main one we focus in this competition. Overall, we have a positive return rate after the whole trade, however, there is not much and we found some aspects that we need to improve and focus on. These reflection will be covered in my next post.</p>

          <p>[TOC]</p>
<p>This is a brief description of my investment methods used in different stock sectors in the middle of the KWHS competition.</p>
<h2 id="Consumer-discretionary-and-technology"><a href="#Consumer-discretionary-and-technology" class="headerlink" title="Consumer discretionary and technology"></a>Consumer discretionary and technology</h2><p>In terms of optional consumer goods, I chose the stock of Disney, which is well-known all over the world. Moreover, due to the epidemic in the first half of the year, Disney’s stock continued to grow in the second half of 2020. In terms of technology, I chose 300537. This stock has a downward trend in the short term, but in the long run, this stock is still on the rise. After the performance disclosure in the third quarter, the upward trend should be more obvious.</p>
<h2 id="Material-and-processing"><a href="#Material-and-processing" class="headerlink" title="Material and processing"></a>Material and processing</h2><p>Based on the Chinese market, due to the severe impact of the epidemic on demand and industrial chain, the utilization rate of industrial capacity is low at present, only 67.3% in the first quarter. However, the utilization rate of some industries is still high, for example, the utilization rate of oil and natural gas exploitation industry reached 89.9%. Therefore, I generally decide to invest in the oil industry sector in the early stage, and replace it with the raw material industry and processing industry sector in the later stage. For the US stock market, since there was an uncertainty of the current US economic policy and the effect of the pandemic, the whole market showed a trend of falling back, our team on the fence about a few stocks, such as X, BECN, CAR.</p>
<h2 id="Energy-and-utility"><a href="#Energy-and-utility" class="headerlink" title="Energy and utility"></a>Energy and utility</h2><p>Because of the global epidemic, public services are not doing well. As a result of the global epidemic, most people choose to stay indoors, so consumer demand is greatly reduced and public services are rarely needed. The state did not provide substantial subsidies, but instead poured money into medical production. So now is not a good time to invest in utilities.<br>Scientific research has also been affected. Most countries put all their money into buying medical equipment and supplies, reducing subsidies and support for scientific research, slowing the pace of scientific research and reducing the profits of research companies. So tech stocks aren’t a good bet for short-term profits. However, in the long run, in the next few decades, scientific and technological innovation is the first driving force to promote national development. Countries will provide long-term support and investment to the science and technology industry if the capital allows, so the long-term development of science and technology stocks is considerable.</p>
<h2 id="Financial-service-and-product-durable"><a href="#Financial-service-and-product-durable" class="headerlink" title="Financial service and product durable"></a>Financial service and product durable</h2><p>I bought shares in Midea because, personally thinking, it’s a leader in electronics, and it’s been innovative lately. Although last year it was neck and neck with Gree, but this year it occupied more than half of the market, the market value of 509.9 billion, we think it is a good choice to invest in it. So we bought 2,227 shares of 000333 and they all went up well.<br>Financial services sector stocks, I chose to buy 4782 shares of 002142. Ningbo Bank in the third quarter overall partial stable, the market down banking business is relatively stable. Third quarter results in line with expectations. The scale of expansion is relatively fast. Under the positive adjustment of the asset-liability structure, the interest spread is widening, and the asset quality continues to be excellent. We expect the company’s net profit growth in 2020 and 2021 to be 5.1% and 11.6% respectively. Citic Group fell a lot after the rally, and we are still watching.</p>
